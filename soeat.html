				<h1>Why SOEAT?</h1>
				
				<h2>Engineering</h2>
				<h3>Structured Internships</h3>
				As they will be a part of a highly practical discipline, engineers require extensive hands on experience for their career advancement. INTI students from every engineering specialisation are given the opportunity to participate in highly structured internships and gain actual insights into the intensive work environment of engineers. INTI's accredited industry partners include Motorola, Intel, Keysight, ASE, Inari, Venture, Lumileds, Knowles, Ceedec, Aemulus, B. Braun, SAM, Osram, Solarvest and more. Through these close collaborations with established employers, students gain invaluable work experiences even before they graduate and acquire the confidence and exposure they need to prepare them for working life. <br><br>
				
				<h3>Employer Projects</h3>
				Throughout the course of their work, engineers often interact with professionals from other fields and across various disciplines, while working under challenging conditions. To prepare them for the working world, students from INTI are assigned employer projects that span a three month period and reflect actual engineering challenges encountered by today's global companies. During this time, students will work with a multi-disciplinary team of fellow engineers and other professionals to fulfil their assigned employer project. To date, INTI graduates have completed major projects with companies such as Motorola Solutions, Intel, Keysight, Robert Bosch, QAV, Knowles Electronics, Flex and many more. Upon completion of these projects, students are given the opportunity to present their findings to their employers, including senior management teams from the organisation. Many of these employers have also gone on to implement the solutions presented, testifying to the quality and capabilities of INTI students. Exceptional students who excel during their employer projects are often offered positions even before they graduate. <br><br>

				<h2>Computing & IT</h2>
				<h3>Career Developement</h3>
				At INTI, we put you at the centre of our high quality learning experiences. The curriculum is designed to nurture innovative ideas and a global mindset, using "Project-based Learning" and "Problem-based Learning" approaches.<br><br>
